# WhatsWapp

A simple Flutter-based Wrapper around WhatsApp Web to make it possible to use WhatsApp as a 
dedicated App on your TABLET, without using your browser or bookmarks.

## Why?
Because especially on iOS, the WhatsApp Web page will get automatically detected as mobile even
though you set the UserAgent to Desktop. This kills my time :-) 

## Usage
Compile and use, it is currently not listed on any AppStore whether Android nor iOS.

Feel free to fork it.
